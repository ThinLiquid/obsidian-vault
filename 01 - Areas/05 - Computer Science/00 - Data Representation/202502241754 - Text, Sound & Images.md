### Easy
#### Q1 _(1 mark)_
The **Unicode** character set is used to represent text that is typed into a computer.

One disadvantage of using the **Unicode** character set, instead of the **ASCII** character set, is that the text stored takes up more storage space.

**Give one reason why** it takes up more storage space.

```ad-correct
Unicode takes up more storage space as:
- Each character is encoded/stored using more bits [1 mark]

#### Q3 _(2 marks)_
A student has a **sound file** that is too large to be stored on their external secondary storage device. The student **compresses** the sound file to make the file size smaller.

The compression method used **reduces** the sample rate and the sample resolution of the sound file.

#### Q1(a) _(3 marks)_
A student is creating a range of documents for a school project.

The student records a podcast about computer science.

**Describe** how an **analogue sound wave** is **converted into digital form**.

```ad-correct
An analogue sound wave is converted into digital form by:
Any **three** from the following:
- (analogue) sound wave is **sampled** **[1 mark]**
    - …**amplitude**/**height** (of wave) is measured **[1 mark]**
    - …at **set/regular time intervals** (e.g. a number of times per second) **[1 mark]**
- Each sample/measurement is stored as a binary number  
    **[1 mark]**
- The binary number for each sample is stored sequentially  
    **[1 mark]**

**[Total: 3 marks]**

- An example of a 3 mark response could be:
	Analogue sound waves are sampled by measuring the amplitude of the wave at regular time intervals. Each measurement is then stored as a binary number.

#### Q2 _(8 marks)_
**Discuss** the trade-offs between **image quality** and **file size** when choosing a bitmap image's resolution and colour depth.

Provide **examples** to illustrate your answer.

```ad-correct
When choosing a bitmap image's resolution and colour depth, there are important trade-offs between image quality and file size.

**Resolution**  
Higher-resolution images have more pixels, which means they contain more detail and have higher quality. However, this also means they have larger file sizes, taking up more storage space and possibly causing slower loading times on websites. On the other hand, lower-resolution images have fewer pixels, which reduces the file size and makes them load faster, but this comes at the cost of image quality, potentially making them look blurry or pixelated when viewed up close or on larger screens.

**Colour depth**  
Regarding colour depth, higher colour depth allows an image to display more colours, leading to better image quality. However, this increases the file size because more bits are needed for each pixel. Lower colour depth reduces the number of colours available, which can make images appear less vibrant but helps in reducing the file size. This is beneficial for faster loading times and less storage usage.

**Examples**  
For example, a professional photograph used for printing requires high resolution and high colour depth to ensure excellent quality, but it results in a large file size. In contrast, a thumbnail image on a website typically has low resolution and low colour depth to ensure faster loading times while sacrificing some quality.
