#### Q1 _(5 marks)_ **☆**
Complete the sentences about symmetric encryption.

Use the terms from the list.

Some of the terms in the list will not be used. You should only use a term **once**.

- **algorithm**
- **cipher**
- **copied**
- **delete**
- **key**
- **plain**
- **private**
- **public**    
- **standard**
- **stolen**
- **understood**
- **unreadable**

The data before encryption is known as .................................................. text. To scramble the data, an encryption .................................................., which is a type of .................................................., is used.

The data after encryption is known as .................................................. text. Encryption prevents the data from being .................................................. by a hacker.
```ad-partial
1. plain
2. cipher
3. algorithm
4. unreadable
5. understood
```
```ad-correct
1. plain
2. key
3. algorithm
4. cipher
5. understood
```
```ad-mark
One mark for each correct term in the correct place.

The data before encryption is known as plain text. To scramble the data, an encryption algorithm/key, which is a type of key/algorithm, is used.

The data after encryption is known as cipher text. Encryption prevents the data from being understood by a hacker.

### Hard
#### Q1 _(4 marks)_
A company is setting up both wireless and wired networks for secure communication between employees. The IT team must ensure that all data transmitted across the networks is encrypted.

**Describe how** encryption protects data transmitted over wireless networks.

In your answer explain:
- the **role** of the 'master key' in this process
- the **importance** of not transmitting the master key
```ad-wrong
The master key is use to encrypt all data on the network, the master key must not be transmitted as the whole network would be put under geopardy.
```
```ad-mark
Encryption protects data transmitted over wireless networks by:
- scrambling data into ciphertext [1 mark]
    - … making it unreadable to anyone intercepting the data [1 mark]

The **role** of the master key is to:
- protect the data from unauthorised access [1 mark]

The **importance** of not transmitting the master key is:
- without the master key, any intercepted data is meaningless and cannot be decrypted [1 mark]
