#### Q1 _(2 marks)_ **★**
An office has an automated lighting system. When movement is detected in the office, the lights are switched on. If movement is not detected for a period of two minutes, the lights are switched off.

The system uses a **sensor** and a microprocessor.

**Identify** the most appropriate **sensor**.
```ad-correct
The most appropriate sensor would be an infared sensor.

#### Q3 _(1 mark)_ **☆**
A farm has an automated drinking system for its animals. The drinking system has a water bowl that contains the water. When the water bowl is empty, it is automatically refilled.

The system uses a **sensor** and a microprocessor.

**Identify** the most appropriate **sensor** for this system.
```ad-correct
The most appropriate sensor would be a moisture sensor
```
```ad-mark
Examples of appropriate sensors for the system include:

Any **one** of the following:
- Level [1 mark]    
- Pressure [1 mark]
- Moisture [1 mark]
    
**[Total: 1 mark]**

The paragraph describes the use of output devices in a modern office.

**Complete the paragraph** using the most appropriate terms from the list. **Not all** of the terms in the list need to be used.

- **actuator**
- **digital light processing (DLP) projector**
- **inkjet printer**
- **lazer printer**
- **light emitting diode (LED) screen**
- **liquid crystal display (LCD) projector**
- **liquid crystal display (LCD) screen**
- **speaker**
- **3D printer**

In a modern office setup, various devices are used to enhance productivity and communication.

For displaying presentations and videos, a [...] (1) is commonly used as it projects high-quality images onto a large screen.

When it comes to producing physical documents, a [...] (2) printer is preferred for its fast and precise text printing, while an [...] (3) printer is chosen if budget is a concern.

For outputting clear audio during meetings or multimedia sessions, a [...] (4) ensures everyone can hear the sound clearly.

Additionally, a [...] (5) screen is often used in office monitors for its bright and sharp display, making it ideal for daily work.

#### Q1 _(6 marks)_
A farm has an automated drinking system for its animals. The drinking system has a water bowl that contains the water. When the water bowl is empty, it is automatically refilled.

The system uses a **sensor** and a **microprocessor**.

**Describe how** the sensor and the microprocessor are used to **automatically refill** the water bowl.
```ad-wrong
The sensor detects the moisture level of the water bowl, if the level is too low water should be pumped into it.
```
```ad-mark
The sensor and microprocessor work together by:

Any **Six** of the following:
- Sensor continually sends digitised data to microprocessor [1 mark]
- Microprocessor compares data to stored value(s) [1 mark]
- If value is outside range / matches microprocessor sends signal to release water to refill water bowl [1 mark]
    - … bowl filled by set amount **OR** bowl filled for certain time [1 mark]
- Actuator used to release water [1 mark]
- Whole process repeats until turned off/stopped [1 mark]
    

**[Total: 6 marks]**
- An example of a six mark response could be:
    
    The sensor continuously checks the water level in the bowl and sends this data to the microprocessor. The microprocessor then compares this data to a pre-set value to determine if the water level is too low.
    
    If the water level is found to be below the desired level, the microprocessor sends a signal to start refilling the bowl. The system either adds a set amount of water or continues filling for a specific period until the bowl reaches the correct level. An actuator is used to release the water into the bowl.
    
    This process repeats automatically, ensuring the bowl remains filled until the system is manually turned off or stopped. This automated cycle helps keep the animals' drinking water at the right level without needing constant human intervention.
