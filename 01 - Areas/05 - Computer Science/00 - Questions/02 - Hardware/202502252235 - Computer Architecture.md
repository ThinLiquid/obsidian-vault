## Questions
### Easy
#### Q1 _(3 marks)_ **☆**
A computer has a Von Neumann architecture.

**Circle three components** that are part of the central processing unit (**CPU**) in this computer.

| Accumulator (ACC)             | Hard disk drive (HDD)   |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Memory address register (MAR) | Program counter (PC)    |
| Random access memory (RAM)    | Read only memory (ROM)  |
| sensor                        | Solid state drive (SSD) |
```ad-partial
Accumulator, read only memory and program counter
```
```ad-correct
ACC, PC, MAR
```
```ad-mark
The three components that are part of the CPU are:
- Accumulator (ACC) [1 mark]
- Program counter (PC) [1 mark]
- Memory address register (MAR) [1 mark]
