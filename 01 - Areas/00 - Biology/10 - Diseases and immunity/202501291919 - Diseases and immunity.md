# Diseases and immunity
## Transmissible diseases
There are many factors that can cause diseases. However, diseases that can be passed from one individual to another are called **transmissible diseases**. Common transmissible diseases include:
- colds
- flu
- food poisoning
- sexually transmitted diseases (STIs).

==Transmissible diseases are caused by **pathogens**.== The organism that is infected by a pathogen is called a **host**. Other groups also include pathogens, such as fungi and bacteria. ==**Viruses** that cause diseases are also called pathogens, even though they aren't living organisms.== 
### Viruses
Viruses are simple proteins which consist of an outer protein coat that protects the genetic material inside.

## Methods of transmission
==Transmission is the process of passing a disease from one host to another== host (uninfected initially). Inside the new host the pathogen will reproduce, so that it can infect others.

There are many ways pathogens can be transmitted:

### Direct contact
==Transmission through direct contact are usually transmitted by the transfer of bodily fluids== including: semen, blood, and other bodily fluids. Bodily fluids are usually exchanged during sexual contact or even through sneezing.

Diseases gained through direct contact include: HIV, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C.
### Indirect contact
Transmission through indirect contact are usually transmitted when then pathogen leaves the host in some way and into an uninfected individual.

Examples of indirect transmission include:
- **transmission through water droplets in air**: colds and flu through coughs or sneezes.
- **transmission through infected drinking water**: cholera, typhoid and dysentery.
- **transmission through contaminated surfaces**: athlete’s foot fungus by walking on damp floors, and salmonella/clostridium through food poisoning pathogens spread by flies that have fed on contaminated food or faeces.
- **transmission through insect bites**: malaria and dengue fever through mosquitoes carrying pathogens.

There are many animals that can transfer pathogens from host to another, for example, mosquitoes and flies, however ==these animals aren’t affected by the disease caused by the pathogens they carry.==

## Questions
> [!question]- Define the term transmissible disease.
> A transmissible disease is a disease caused by pathogens that attaches to any living organism.

> [!question]- Give one example of a direct method of transmission of disease, and one example of an indirect method. In each case identify a disease transmitted between humans in this way
> An example of a direct method of transmission of disease is sexual contact, in which, HIV is transmitted, and an example of an indirect method of transmission of disease is flu, which is transmitted through coughing or sneezing.

> [!question]- Using a particular example, suggest one way to reduce the risk of transmission of a disease. Explain why your suggestion would work.
> You can reduce the risk of transmitting a disease by wearing a face mask which traps the pathogens, stopping them from passing into the air.
