# Oxidation, reduction and redox
When oxygen is added to an element or compound the process is called **oxidation**:
$$\ce{2Cu(s) + O2(g) -> 2CuO(s)}$$
The copper as been oxidized.
Removing oxygen from a compound is called **reduction**:
$$\ce{CuO(s) + ZnO(s) -> ZnO(s) + Cu(s)}$$
The copper(II) oxide has been reduced. If you look closer at this reaction, you'll see that the zinc has changed into zinc oxide. This means that the zinc was oxidized whilst the copper(II) oxide was reduced.

Reactions like this where there is a gain and a loss of oxygen are called **redox** reactions.

> Oxidation is a loss of electrons, whereas reduction is a gain of electrons.
## Oxidation numbers
Take for example the compound iron(II) oxide. The II is an oxidation number. $\ce{Fe^{2+}}$ has an oxidation number of $+2$ whereas $\ce{O^{2-}}$ has an oxidation state of $-2$.

An oxidation number describes how many electrons an atom gains or loses when it forms a chemical bond.
