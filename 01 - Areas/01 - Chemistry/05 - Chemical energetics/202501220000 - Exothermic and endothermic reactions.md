# Exothermic and endothermic reactions
## Thermal energy transfer in chemical reactions
In most chemical reactions, thermal energy is released into the surroundings, causing the temperature of the surroundings to increase. These reactions are **exothermic**. Examples of exothermic reactions include combustion (burning), neutralization and oxidization.

On the other hand, thermal energy from the surroundings is absorbed, causing the temperature of the surroundings to decrease. These reactions are **endothermic**. Some examples of endothermic reactions include photosynthesis, thermal decomposition and the reaction of citric acid and sodium hydrogen carbonate.

> A simple way to distinguish the two reactions is to remember that in exothermic reactions, energy **ex**its the system, while in endothermic reactions, energy **en**ters it.

## Reaction pathway diagrams
If the total energy of the reactants is larger than the products, then it's an exothermic reaction, whereas, the total chemical energy is smaller than the products making it an endothermic reaction.

## Calculating the enthalpy change
1. Write the balanced equation for the reaction.
2. Find the 'energy in' ― the total bond energies for all bonds in the reactants (left-hand side)
3. Find the 'energy out' ― the total bond energies for all bonds in the products (right-hand side)
4. Use the formula below to find the enthalpy change:
   $$\text{enthalpy change}\space(\Delta H)=\text{energy taken in}-\text{energy given out}$$

> enthalpy is the chemical energy involved in a reaction

If the energy in is less than the energy out, the reaction is exothermic (negative $\Delta H$), and if the energy in is greater than the energy out, the reaction is endothermic (positive $\Delta H$).

## Bond breaking and bond making
Bond making is an exothermic process, whereas bond breaking is an endothermic process.

In exothermic reactions, energy is released when bonds are made, and in endothermic reactions, energy is taken in to break bonds apart.

If the energy needed to break bonds is less than the energy released, then it's an exothermic reaction (negative $\Delta H$). If the energy needed to break bonds is greater than the energy released, it's an endothermic reaction (positive $\Delta H$).
