# Exothermic and endothermic reactions
## Thermal energy transfer in chemical reactions
In most chemical reactions, thermal energy is released into the surroundings, causing the temperature of the surroundings to increase. These reactions are **exothermic**. Examples of exothermic reactions include combustion (burning), neutralization and oxidization.

On the other hand, thermal energy from the surroundings is absorbed, causing the temperature of the surroundings to decrease. These reactions are **endothermic**. Some examples of endothermic reactions include photosynthesis, thermal decomposition and the reaction of citric acid and sodium hydrogen carbonate.

> A simple way to distinguish the two reactions is to remember that in exothermic reactions, energy **ex**its the system, while in endothermic reactions, energy **en**ters it.

## Reaction pathway diagrams
If the total energy of the reactants is larger than the products, then it's an exothermic reaction, whereas, the total chemical energy is smaller than the products making it an endothermic reaction.
