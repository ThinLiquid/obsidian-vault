# Kinetic particle model of matter
## States of matter
Three states of matter have different properties:
- A solid has a **defined volume and shape**, is not easily compressed and does not flow easily. They are arranged in a regular pattern, and has a strong force of attraction.
- A liquid **takes the shape of the part of the container it occupies** (usually at the lowest level), is not easily compressed and flows easily. They are arranged in an irregular pattern, and has a weak force of attraction.
- A gas **takes the shape and volume of the container**, occupying the whole volume, can easily be compressed and flows easily. They aren't arranged, they are constantly moving in a random motion, and they have a **very weak force of attraction causing them to move far away**.

Matter can change states.

### What exactly is matter?
Matter is a substance that makes up all physical objects, it has weight and space.
## Brownian motion
Brownian motion is the random movement of particles in liquids or gases due to collision.
> Massive particles may be moved by light, fast-moving molecules

The higher the temperature the greater the kinetic energy and the faster the speed of the molecules.
## Converting Celsius to Kelvin
Absolute temperature is temperature measured using the Kelvin scale where zero is *actually* absolute zero.
$$\text{kelvin}=\text{celcius}+273.15$$
## Boyle's law
$$\begin{align*}V&\propto\frac{1}{P}\\ V&=\frac{k}{P}\\ k&=PV\end{align*}$$
$$P_1V_1=P_2V_2$$
### Example
$$\begin{align*}
V_1=(5.0\times10^3)\text{ cm$^3$}\\
P_1=(8.0\times10^5)\text{ Pa}\\
P_2=(1.0\times10^5)\text{ Pa}\\
\\
P_1V_1&=P_2V_2\\
(5.0\times10^3)(8.0\times10^5)&=(1.0\times10^5)(V_2)\\
V_2&=\frac{(8.0\times10^5)(5.0\times10^3)}{(1.0\times10^5)}\\
V_2&=4.0\times10^4
\end{align*}$$
