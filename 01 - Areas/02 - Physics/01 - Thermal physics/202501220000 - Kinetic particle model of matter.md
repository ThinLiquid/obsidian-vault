# Kinetic particle model of matter
## States of matter
Three states of matter have different properties:
- A solid has a fixed volume and shape, is not easily compressed and does not flow easily.
- A liquid takes the shape of the part of the container it occupies (usually the lowest level), is not easily compressed and flows easily.
- A gas takes the shape and volume of the container, occupying the whole volume, can easily be compressed and flows easily.

Matter can change states. A solid changing into a liquid is called **melting**; liquid to gas is called **evaporation**. A gas changing into a liquid is called **condensation**; liquid to solid is called **solidification**. Solid to gas
