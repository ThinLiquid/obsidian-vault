# Physical quantities and measurement techniques
## Making Measurements
When making measurements **accuracy** is key. To increase accuracy, you can take **multiple readings** and average to get a more precise value.
### Measuring the volume of liquids
Liquids will typically be measured in milliliters (ml), and $1\text{ ml}$ is the same as $1\text{ cm}^3$.
$$1000 \text{ cm}^3 = 1000\text{ ml} = 1\text{ l}$$
For measuring larger volumes, there is the cubic meter.
$$1\text{ m}^3 = 1000\text{ dm}^3 = 1,000,000\text{ cm}^3$$
#### Using a measuring cylinder
When using a measuring cylinder, it should be on a **level** and **stable** surface. Your eye must be at the same level as the liquid. The surface of the liquid may bend around the sides of the measuring cylinder. The curvy shape is called a **meniscus**, when looking at this shape, you should measure based off of the lowest point.
### Measuring time intervals
Time intervals are measured using clocks of various types. However, in a lab you would use a stopwatch. Hand-based stopwatches have less accuracy than other methods of keeping time, as it is limited by a human's **reaction time** which is around $0.2\text{ s}$. If you are aiming for higher accuracy you can use a light-based stopwatch, which automatically stops when the light is obstructed.
#### Measuring periods
When determining the **[[period]]** of an [[oscillation]], in this case a pendulum, you should count multiple swings due to how short the period is.

In this scenario, you let the swing go, count from zero and start the stopwatch as soon as the pendulum crosses the **fiducial mark** for the first time. From then on, you can count up. Say you measure 20 swings, divide the total time by 20 and you will have the period of oscillation.

As an example, it takes $22\text{ s}$ for 20 oscillations, then the period must be $\frac{22}{20} = 1.1\text{ s}$.
