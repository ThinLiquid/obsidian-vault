### Energy stores
| Store                           | Description                                                                                               | Some Examples                                                                                  |

| Kinetic energy store            | Energy stored in a moving object. Faster moving objects have greater kinetic energy                       | Runners, moving cars and planets orbiting the Sun.                                             |
| Gravitational energy store      | Energy stored by an object due to its height or position. The higher an object is the greater the energy. | Person in a tall building, a cuckoo clock and an airplane in the sky.                          |
| Chemical energy store           | Energy stored in chemical bonds, such as those between atoms and molecules.                               | Electrical battery, muscles, petrol and food.                                                  |
| Elastic (strain) energy store   | Energy stored when an object is squashed or stretched                                                     | An extended rubber band, a compressed spring and a blown-up balloon.                           |
| Nuclear energy store            | Energy stored in the nucleus of an atom and which can be released in nuclear reactions.                   | Nuclear power station and glowing stars.                                                       |
| Electrostatic energy store      | Energy stored when like charges are moved closer or unlike charges are moved further apart.               | Thunderclouds, attraction of plastic covering to one's hand when it is removed from a package. |
| Internal (thermal) energy store | Energy stored in the movement of particles of a material and how close the particles are to each other.   | A hot cup of coffee, fires and warm human bodies.                                              |
