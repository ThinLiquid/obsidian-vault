## Gas Pressure
The pressure on the wall of a container is caused by the collisions made by the gas. ==Each molecule exerts a tiny force on the piston. The force on the whole piston is the sum of all of the tiny forces.==

As an example, when you block the tip of a bicycle pump, and try to pump air, the pump will keep going back up. ==If the molecules move faster, then they'll hit the piston in the pump more often and with greater force==. The pressure on the piston and the walls will go up. This is also the same effect as increasing the temperature of the air inside.
## Pressure Changes
### Pressure and temperature at constant volume
When the volume of the gas is constant, then the pressure exerted by the gas increases as the temperature increases. Gas molecules move faster and have greater kinetic energy when the temperature goes up. The gas molecules collide with greater force with the container walls.
### Pressure and volume at constant temperature
==When the tip of a bicycle pump is blocked, then the more you push, the harder it gets to push it further==. This is because the pressure in the container goes up as its volume gets smaller because the molecules are packed more densely, there are more collisions with the walls and piston per second. â€“ see [[Boyle's law]]
## Brownian motion
Brownian motion is the random movement of particles in liquids or gases due to collision. Massive particles may be moved by light, fast-moving molecules.
> [!tldr] The higher the temperature, the greater the kinetic energy thus the speed of the molecules increase.
## Converting Celsius to Kelvin
Absolute temperature is temperature measured using the Kelvin scale where zero is _actually_ absolute zero.
$$\text{kelvin}=\text{celcius}+273.15$$
# Questions
> [!question]- Describe what happens to the motion of atoms as the temperature increases.
> The motion of atoms **increases (vibrates more)** as the temperature increases.

> [!question]- Explain why it is easier to compress a gas than a liquid.
