# Motion
## Calculating speed
The formula for calculating speed is:
$$v=\frac{s}{t}$$
where $v=\text{speed}$, $s=\text{distance}$ and $t=\text{time}$. When finding a value from an object that isn't moving at a constant speed $v=\text{average speed}$, $s=\text{total distance}$ and $t=\text{total time}$.
## Examples
### Example 01
A car travels a distance of $500\text{ m}$ in $20\text{ s}$. What is the speed of the car?
$$\begin{align*}
v&=\frac{s}{t}\\
v&=\frac{500}{20}\\
v&=25\text{ m/s}
\end{align*}$$
### Example 02
A cyclist has an average speed of $5\text{ m/s}$ for $2\text{ minutes}$. Find the total distance travelled.
$$\begin{align*}
v&=\frac{s}{t}\\
s&=v\times t\\
s&=5\times(2\times60)\\
s&=600\text{ m}
\end{align*}$$

> The value of $2\text{ minutes}$ is multiplied by $60$ so that the value is turned into seconds.
## Using graphs to study motion
Journeys can be visualized as graphs. The simplest graph is a **[[distance-time graph]]**, where the x-axis represents distance ($s$), and the y-axis represents time ($t$).

> At the beginning of a measurement of motion, the distance and time values are usually at 0.

If the object is not moving, a horizontal line will be formed as time increases, and the distance does not. However if the object moves at a steady speed, a straight line of constant **gradient** will form as both distance and time increase steadily.

On a distance-time graph, you can calculate the speed of the object by finding the gradient of the line. If the speed varies the line will not be straight.

### Calculating speed from the gradient of a distance-time graph
Since $\text{speed}=\frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}}$, you can calculate the constant speed from the gradient of a distance-time graph.

In the graph above, there is a straight line from $20\text{ s}$ to $60\text{ s}$. In that duration, the distance increases from $30\text{ m}$ to $150\text{ m}$. So the speed in that duration would be:

$$\begin{align*}
v&=\frac{150-30}{60-20}\\
&=\frac{120}{40}\\
&=3\text{ m/s}
\end{align*}$$
### Speed-time graph
In a speed-time graph, the time ($t$) represents the x-axis and the speed ($v$) represents the y-axis.

In the graph above, the object has a constant speed between $t=0$ and $t={2\text{ s}}$ of $1\text{ m/s}$. After $t=2\text{ s}$, the object's speed increases steadily at a rate of $0.5\text{ m/s}$ per second. It has a constant **[[acceleration]]**.
