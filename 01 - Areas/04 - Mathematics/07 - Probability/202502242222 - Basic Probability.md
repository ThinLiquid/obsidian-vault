##### Q1 _(1 mark)_ **★**
A box contains 3 blue pens, 4 red pens and 8 green pens only. A pen is chosen at random from the box.

Find the probability that this pen is green.
```ad-correct
$$\text{P}(G)=\dfrac{8}{3+4+8}=\dfrac{8}{15}$$
```
##### Q2 _(1 mark)_ **★**
Samira has a bag containing 20 sweets. In the bag, there are 5 red, 6 green and 9 yellow sweets.

Samira chooses one sweet at random from the bag.

Write down the probability that she chooses a yellow sweet.
```ad-correct
$$\text{P}(Y)=\dfrac{9}{20}$$
```
##### Q3 _(2 marks)_ **★**
The probability that a biased dice will land on a five is 0.3

Megan is going to roll the dice 400 times.

Work out an estimate for the number of times the dice will land on a five.
```ad-correct
$$\dfrac{3}{10}\times\dfrac{400}{1}=\dfrac{3}{1}\times\dfrac{40}{1}=120$$
```
##### Q4(a) _(1 mark)_ **★**
Jane has a packet of seeds. The probability that a seed will grow is 0.75

What is the probability that a seed will **not** grow?
```ad-correct
$$1-0.75=0.25$$
```
##### Q4(b) _(2 marks)_ **★**
Jane plants 200 of these seeds.

Estimate the number of the seeds that will grow.
```ad-correct
$$\dfrac{200}{1}\times\dfrac{75}{100}=\dfrac{2}{1}\times\dfrac{75}{1}=150$$

The diagram shows six discs. Each disc has a colour and a number.

One disc is picked at random. Write down the probability that

i) the disc has the number 4,
ii) the disc is red and has the number 3,
iii) the disc is blue and has the number 4.
```ad-correct
1. {i} $$\text{P}(\text{four})=\dfrac{2}{6}=\dfrac{1}{3}$$
2. $$\text{P}(\text{three}\cap\text{red})=\frac{0}{6}=0$$
3. $$\text{P}(\text{four}\cap\text{blue})=\frac{1}{6}$$

##### Q6 _(1 mark)_ **★**
The heights, meters, of the 120 boys in an athletics club are recorded.  
The table shows information about the heights of the boys.

| Height ($h\text{ meters}$) | $1.3\lt h\le1.4$ | $1.4\lt h\le1.5$ | $1.5\lt h\le1.6$ | $1.6\lt h\le1.7$ | $1.7\lt h\le1.8$ | $1.8\lt h\le1.9$ |
|-----------|---|----|----|----|----|----|
| Frequency | 7 | 18 | 30 | 24 | 27 | 14 |

One boy is chosen at random from the club.

Find the probability that this boy has a height greater than 1.8 m.
```ad-correct
$$\text{P}(\text{$h$ greater than 1.8})=\dfrac{14}{14+27+24+30+18+7}=\dfrac{14}{120}=\dfrac{7}{60}$$
```
##### Q7 _(1 mark)_  **★**
The test scores of 14 students are shown below.

| 21  | 21  | 23  | 26  | 25  | 21  | 22  | 20  | 21  | 23  | 23  | 27  | 24  | 21  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

A student is chosen at random.  

Find the probability that this student has a test score of more than 24.
```ad-correct
$$\dfrac{3}{14}$$
```
##### Q8 _(1 mark)_ **★**
20 students each record the mass, $p$ grams, of their pencil case. The table below shows the results.

| Mass ($p$ grams) | $0\lt p\le50$ | $50\lt p\le100$ | $100\lt p\le125$ | $125\lt p\le150$ | $150\lt p\le200$ |
| ---------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Frequency        | 2             | 5               | 4                | 6                | 3                |

A student is chosen at random.  

Find the probability that this student has a pencil case with a mass greater than 150 g.
```ad-correct
$$\text{P}(\text{$p$ greater than 150})=\dfrac{3}{2+5+4+6+3}=\dfrac{3}{20}$$
```

##### Q1(a) _(2 marks)_ **★**
A bag contains blue, red, yellow and green balls only. A ball is taken from the bag at random.  
The table shows some information about the probabilities.

| Colour      | Blue | Red | Yellow | Green |
| ----------- | ---- | --- | ------ | ----- |
| Probability | 0.15 | 0.2 |        | 0.43  |

Complete the table.
```ad-correct
$$1-(0.15+0.2+0.43)=0.22$$
```
##### Q1(b) _(1 mark)_ **★**
Abdul takes a ball at random and replaces it in the bag. He does this 200 times.

Find how many times he expects to take a red ball.
```ad-correct
$$\dfrac{200}{1}\times\dfrac{2}{10}=\dfrac{20}{1}\times\dfrac{2}{1}=40$$
```
##### Q2 _(2 marks)_
A group of 200 people were asked which city they would like to visit next. The table shows the results.

| City             | London | Paris | New York | Tokyo |
| ---------------- | ------ | ----- | -------- | ----- |
| Number of people | 50     | 48    | 56       | 46    |

A person from the group is chosen at random.  

Write down the probability that this person would like to visit either Paris or Tokyo next.
```ad-wrong
$$\dfrac{48}{200}\times\dfrac{50}{200}=\dfrac{12}{50}\times\dfrac{1}{4}=\dfrac{3}{50}$$
The mistakes I made were:
1. Using an incorrect value *accidentally*
2. Multiplying instead of adding the values
```
```ad-correct
$$\dfrac{48+46}{50+48+56+46}=\dfrac{94}{200}=\dfrac{47}{100}$$
```
```ad-mark
Work out the number of people you want (by adding the Paris and Tokyo values)

$$48 + 46 = 94$$

Calculate the probability (by dividing the number of people you want, 48, by the number of people in total, 200)

$$\dfrac{94}{200}$$

`.right` [1]

Simplify the fraction

`.right` $\dfrac{47}{100}$ [1]

Any equivalent form of the answer is acceptable, e.g. 0.47
