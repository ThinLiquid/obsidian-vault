# Types of numbers
> [!tldr]
> Rational numbers are numbers that have a limited number of decimal places, meaning they can be written as fractions. Irrational numbers are numbers that continue forever, meaning they always have to be rounded.

## Rational numbers
See [[integers]], [[fractions]] and [[decimals]]
## Irrational numbers
Irrational numbers are [[decimals]] that continue forever, but the numbers do not repeat. Examples of irrational numbers include $\pi$, $\sqrt{2}$. Irrational numbers are usually found as surds, specifically square roots of non-square numbers.
