##### Q2 _(2 marks)_ **☆**
A group of 200 people were asked which city they would like to visit next. The table shows the results.

| City             | London | Paris | New York | Tokyo |
| ---------------- | ------ | ----- | -------- | ----- |
| Number of people | 50     | 48    | 56       | 46    |

A person from the group is chosen at random.  

Write down the probability that this person would like to visit either Paris or Tokyo next.
```ad-wrong
$$\dfrac{48}{200}\times\dfrac{50}{200}=\dfrac{12}{50}\times\dfrac{1}{4}=\dfrac{3}{50}$$
The mistakes I made were:
1. Using an incorrect value *accidentally*
2. Multiplying instead of adding the values
```
```ad-correct
$$
\dfrac{48+46}{50+48+56+48}=\dfrac{94}{200}=\dfrac{47}{100}
$$
```
```ad-mark
Work out the number of people you want (by adding the Paris and Tokyo values)

$$48 + 46 = 94$$

Calculate the probability (by dividing the number of people you want, 48, by the number of people in total, 200)

$$\dfrac{94}{200}$$

`.right` [1]

Simplify the fraction

`.right` $\dfrac{47}{100}$ [1]

Any equivalent form of the answer is acceptable, e.g. 0.47
