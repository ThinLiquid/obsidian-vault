$\fbox{ 1 }\fbox{ 2 }\fbox{ 3 }\fbox{ 4 }\fbox{ 5 }$

The diagram shows five cards.  
Two of the cards are taken at random, without replacement.

Find the probability that both cards show an even number.
```ad-mark
For the first pick, there are 5 cards, and 2 are even (2 and 4)

$$\text{Probability of even on first pick}=\dfrac{2}{5}$$

Considering that we have already picked an even card, and that it is not replaced, there is now only 1 even card left, out of a total of 4

$$\text{Probability of even on second pick}=$\dfrac{1}{4}$$

We need both of these events to occur, so their probabilities are multiplied

$$\dfrac{2}{5}\times\dfrac{1}{4}=\dfrac{1}{10}$$

`.right` _For multiplying the two probabilities_ [1]

`.right` **$\dfrac{1}{10}$** [1]
