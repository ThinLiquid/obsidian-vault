`.right` **The second option is correct, hexagon-based pyramid**Â [1]

A hexagonal prism has two lots of six vertices, six at either end. $6 + 6 = 12$

A pentagonal prism has two lots of five vertices, five at either end. $5 + 5 = 10$

A pentagon-based pyramid has 5 vertices on its base and one at its tip. $5 + 1 = 6$
