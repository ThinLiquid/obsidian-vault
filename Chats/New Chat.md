Hello! I'm here to help you with your queries.

For the first query, you are asking about the energy changes that take place when a cyclist rides down a hill without pedaling. According to Fig 5.1 in your knowledge, bubbles are present when the water is boiling, which means that thermal energy (heat) is being supplied to the water. As the water molecules in the saucepan are constantly moving and gaining kinetic energy, the temperature of the water remains at $100\textdegree\text{C}$.

Now, coming to your query, when a cyclist rides down a hill without pedaling, there are two energy changes that take place:

1. Potential energy change: As the cyclist gains height by riding down the hill, their potential energy increases. This means that the gravitational potential energy of the cyclist and the bike is converted into kinetic energy as they move down the hill.
2. Kinetic energy change: As the cyclist moves down the hill without pedaling, their kinetic energy increases due to the gain in velocity.

Similarly, when a cyclist pedals up a hill at a constant speed, there are also two energy changes:

1. Potential energy change: As the cyclist gains height by pedaling up the hill, their potential energy increases. This means that the gravitational potential energy of the cyclist and the bike is converted into kinetic energy as they move up the hill.
2. Kinetic energy change: As the cyclist moves up the hill at a constant speed, their kinetic energy remains constant.

Now, let's move on to the second query. When a car of mass $940\text{ kg}$ is travelling at $16\text{ m/s}$, there are two energy changes that take place:

1. Kinetic energy change: As the car moves with a constant velocity, its kinetic energy remains constant.
2. Potential energy change: As the car is moving with a non-zero velocity, it has kinetic energy and potential energy. The potential energy of the car is equal to the mass of the car multiplied by the height of the car above the ground.

To calculate the kinetic energy of the car, we can use the formula $K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$, where $m$ is the mass of the car and $v$ is its velocity. Substituting the values given in the query, we get $K = \frac{1}{2}(940\text{ kg})(\frac{16\text{ m/s}}{2})^2 = 37640\text{ J}$.

Now, when the car is brought to rest by applying the brakes, the total mass of the brakes is $4.5\text{ kg}$, and the average specific heat capacity of the brake material is $520\text{ J/(kg}\textdegree\text{C)}$. To calculate the rise in temperature of the brakes, we can use the formula $Q = mc\Delta T$, where $m$ is the mass of the substance, $c$ is its specific heat capacity, and $\Delta T$ is the change in temperature. Substituting the values given in the query, we get $Q = (4.5\text{ kg})(520\text{ J/(kg}\textdegree\text{C)})(\frac{\textdegree\text{C}}{100}) = 210\text{ J}$.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further queries.
