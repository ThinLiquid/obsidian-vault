# Magnetism
A magnet is a material that produces a magnetic field.
Magnetic forces arise from interactions between these magnetic fields.

A magnet has a pole at either end; a north (N) pole and a south (S) pole.
The force between magnetic poles depends on which poles are facing one-another.

Like poles experience **repulsion**.
Opposite poles experience **attraction**.

Magnetic materials are materials that are **attracted to magnets** and can be **magnetized**. Examples are iron, steel, cobalt, nickel.
Non-magnetic materials are materials that are **not attracted to magnets** and **cannot be magnetized**.

Magnetic materials can be permanently magnetized or temporarily magnetized.
Permanent magnets are magnetically hard. An example is steel. They are more useful when they don't need to be turned.
Temporary magnets are magnetically soft. An example is soft iron.

The magnetic field is the region around a magnetic material.

Field lines around a bar magnet point from north to south. 
Field strength depends on the positioning of the magnetic materials.
Plotting compasses are small compasses which show the direction and shape of a magnetic field.
