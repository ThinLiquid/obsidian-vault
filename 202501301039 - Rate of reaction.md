# Rate of reaction
## Physical and chemical changes
Physical changes are when [[states of matter|changes of state]] occur. You can separate products of physical reactions because they aren't chemically combined; and because physical changes do not involve chemical reactions, no new substances are formed, e.g. fractional distillation of crude oil.

Chemical changes require a chemical reaction, and the product must have a different chemical composition. Atoms aren't made or destroyed during chemical reactions, so the mass is conserved ($\text{total mass of the reactant}=\text{total mass of the product}$). In the same way [[principle of conservation of energy|energy cannot be created or destroyed]], atoms cannot be created or destroyed in the face of a chemical reaction. An example of a chemical change is a neutralization reactions to produce salt.
### Differences
| Physical change                                 | Chemical change                                                                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Reversible                                      | Irreversible                                                                                                                                        |
| No significant energy change                    | Large energy change, the [[202501220000 - Exothermic and endothermic reactions\|energy is either taken in (endothermic) or released (exothermic)]]. |
| Usually no color change                         | Color change can occur                                                                                                                              |
| Examples include freezing, melting and boiling  | Examples include cooking, digestion and burning.
