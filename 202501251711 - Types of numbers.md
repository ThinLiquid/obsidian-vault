# Types of numbers
## Integers
Integers are whole numbers. Examples of whole numbers include $9$, $-13$ and $0$.
## Fractions
Fractions are a part of a whole number.
## Decimals
There are two types of fractions **terminating decimals** and **recurring decimals**. Terminating decimals have a limited number of decimal places, whilst recurring decimals continue indefinitely.

> Recurring decimals are **not** irrational numbers.

Examples of terminating decimals include $0.654$, $0.5$ and $0.25$. Examples of recurring decimals include $0.\overline{6}$ and $0.\overline{3}$.
### Fractions
Decimals can also be represented as fractions. As an example $0.5$ is equivalent to $\frac{1}{2}$.

> When working with larger decimals like $0.792$, you can turn them into a fraction like $\frac{792}{1000}$.
### Irrational numbers
Irrational numbers are decimals that continue forever, but the numbers do not repeat. Examples of irrational numbers include $\pi$, $\sqrt{2}$. Irrational numbers are usually found as surds, specifically square roots of non-square numbers.
