##### Q1 _(2 marks)_ **☆**
The mass, $m$ kilograms, of a horse is 429 kg, correct to the nearest kilogram.

Complete this statement about the value of $m$.
```ad-wrong
$428\le m\lt430$
I was just clueless lmfao
```
```ad-correct
$428.5\le m\lt429.5$
```
```ad-mark
The mass has been rounded to the nearest kilogram, so add and subtract half a kilogram to the value.

$$
\text{Lower bound}=429-\dfrac{1}{2}(1)\\
\text{Upper bound}=429+\dfrac{1}{2}(1)
$$

`.right` **$428.5\le m\lt429.5$**

##### Q7 _(2 marks)_
The mass of a cat is 4.3 kg correct to 2 significant figures.

i) Write down the upper bound of the weight of the cat.
ii) Write down the lower bound of the weight of the cat.

```ad-mark
i) The next biggest two significant figure that the mass could have rounded to is 4.4. The upper bound for a mass which rounds to 4.3 is halfway between 4.3 and 4.4. The difference between the values is 0.1 so you need to add 0.05 to the rounded value.

$$4.3 + 0.05 = 4.35$$

`.right` **Upper bound is 4.35 kg** [1]

ii) The next smallest two significant figure that the mass could have rounded to is 4.2. The lower bound for a mass which rounds to 4.3 is halfway between 4.2 and 4.3. The difference between the values is 0.1 so you need to subtract 0.05 from the rounded value.

$$4.3 - 0.05 = 4.25$$

`.right` **Lower bound is 4.25 kg** [1]
