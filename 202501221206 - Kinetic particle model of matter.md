# Kinetic particle model of matter
## "Particle theory" (kinetic theory)
- **Solids**
	- Strong forces of attraction ― held close together
	- Defined shape and volume ― fixed shape
	- Molecules are close together in a regular pattern
	- Cannot be compressed
- **Liquids**
	- Weak forces of attraction ― free to move
	- Shape can change, flows to fit a container
	- Molecules are close together in an irregular pattern
	- Cannot be compressed
- **Gases**
	- Very weak forces of attraction ― free to move
	- Constantly moving with random motion
	- Can be compressed
## What is matter?
Matter is a substance that makes up all physical objects, it has weight and space.
