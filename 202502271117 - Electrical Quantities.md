# Electrical Quantities
Electric charge is the fundamental property of subatomic particles.
Electrical charge can be either positive or negative.
The unit of charge is the coulomb (C).
Opposite charges experience an attractive force.
Like charges experience a repulsion force.
Charging a body involves the addition or removal of electrons.
Conductors are materials which allow electric charge to flow through them.
Examples include: metals
Insulators are materials which impede the flow of electric charge
Examples include: plastics
Charge can be detected using a gold leaf electroscope
An electric field is the region in which an electric charge experiences attractive or repulsive forces
