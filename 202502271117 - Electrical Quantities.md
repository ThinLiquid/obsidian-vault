# Electrical Quantities
Electric charge is the fundamental property of subatomic particles.
Electrical charge can be either positive or negative.
The unit of charge is the coulomb (C).
Opposite charges experience an attractive force.
Like charges experience a repulsion force.
Charging a body involves the addition or removal of electrons.
Conductors are materials which allow electric charge to flow through them, examples include metals.
Insulators are materials which impede the flow of electric charge, examples include plastics.
Charge can be detected using a gold leaf electroscope

An electric field is the region in which an electric charge experiences attractive or repulsive forces
The direction of the field line at a point is shown using arrows on the field lines
The field lines for a positive charge point radially outward
The field lines for a negative charge point radially inwards
