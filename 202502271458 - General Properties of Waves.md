The following table shows some examples of waves

Which row correctly lists the nature of each of the wave types?

|       | **Sound waves** | **Infrared waves** | **Red light waves** |
|-------|-----------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| **A** | transverse      | longitudinal       | transverse          |
| **B** | longitudinal    | transverse         | transverse          |
| **C** | longitudinal    | longitudinal       | transverse          |
| **D** | transverse      | transverse         | longitudinal        |

#### Q2 _(1 mark)_
What is the definition of the word **amplitude**?
1. {A} The number of complete waves that pass a point per second.
2. The distance from the peak of one wave to the peak of an adjacent wave.
3. The distance from the equilibrium position of a peak plus the same distance from a trough.
4. The maximum distance from the equilibrium position of any point on a wave.
```ad-wrong
C
```
```ad-mark
The correct answer is **D** because:
- Amplitude is shown on the diagram, as is wavelength.
- Amplitude is the maximum distance from the equilibrium position of any point on a wave.

**A** is incorrect as this is the definition of frequency.

**B** is incorrect as this is the definition of wavelength.

**C** is incorrect as this is the standard error made by students when defining amplitude.
