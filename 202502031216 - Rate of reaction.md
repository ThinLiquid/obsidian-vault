# Rate of reaction
The rate of reaction is the time taken for a reactant to be used up or products to be formed.
## Factors that affect the rate of reaction
1. change in temperature
2. change in concentration
3. change in pressure
4. change in surface area
increase in temperature increases rate of reaction, decrease slows down the rate of reaction.
