# Transfer of thermal energy
Thermal energy can be transferred in 3 major mechanisms:
1. Conduction
2. Convection
3. Radiation

## Conduction
Needs to come in contact with another object. As an example, when ironing clothes the heat is transferred from the iron to the cloth via contact.
> Only applies to solids and liquids
## Convection
Convection occurs when molecules in a fluid with high thermal energy move to an area with low thermal energy. As an example, boiling water starts heating up from the bottom of the container causing the hotter liquids to rise up and the less heated liquids go to the bottom
### Examples
#### Boiling water
- moment increases
- hot liquid goes to top
- colder regions become hot
#### Hot air balloon
> Only applies to fluids (liquids and gases)
## Radiation
No contact. Thermal energy is transferred through infared radiation which doesn't require any medium.
### Examples
#### The Sun
- distance 150,000,000km

### Factors that affect thermal radiation
1. Temperature of the object
2. Color of the object
3. The surface area of the object
