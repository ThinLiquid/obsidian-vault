The higher the pressure, the lower the volume. The lower the pressure, the higher the volume. The pressure and volume are inversely proportional.
## Differences between boiling and evaporation
|Boiling|Evaporation|
|---|---|
|Occurs at fixed temperature|At any temperature|
|Quick process|Slow process|
|Bubbles are formed|No bubbles are formed|
|Takes place throughout the liquid|Takes place at the surface|
|Temperature remains constant|Temperature may change|
|Thermal energy is supplied by an energy source|Thermal energy supplied by the environment|
## Evaporation

> [!note] Draught is cool air

Evaporation cools down the body.
## Specific heat capacity
The amount of thermal energy to increase the temperature by $1\textdegree\text{C}$ for a mass of $1\text{ kg}$ of the substance.
$$\begin{align}
\Delta E&=mc\Delta T \\
\text{change in thermal energy ($\Delta E$)}&=\text{mass}\times\text{specific heat capacity}\times\text{temperature change}
\end{align}$$
The thermal capacity of a body is how much energy needs to be put in to raise its temperature by a given amount.
> [!important] 
> $\Delta E$ is the change in thermal energy in $\text{J}$.
> $c$ is the specific heat capacity $J(kg^{-1}\textdegree\text{C}^{-1})$.
> $\Delta T$ is the change in temperature in $\textdegree\text{C}$.

> [!note]
> $\text{thermal capacity}=mc$
> $\text{thermal energy}=ml$
