# Gravitational field strength
> [!quote] **Gravitational field strength** ($g$) is defined as the gravitational force acting on an object per unit mass. 

The formula for gravitational field strength is:
$$g=\frac{W}{m}$$
where $W$ is the [[weight]] of the object in newtons, and $m$ is the [[mass]] of the object in kilograms.

The gravitational field strength near to the surface of the Earth is around $9.8\text{ N/kg}$. This means the weight of a $1\text{ kg}$ object on Earth will be around $9.8\text{ N}$. With this context, an object of mass $100\text{ kg}$ will be around $980\text{ N}$.
