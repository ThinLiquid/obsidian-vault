# Distance-time graph 
## Deducing motion from a distance-time graph
| State of object                | Shape of distance-time graph        |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| At rest                        | Horizontal line.                    |
| Moving at a constant speed     | Straight line of positive gradient. |
| Moving with non-constant speed | Curve (not a straight line).
