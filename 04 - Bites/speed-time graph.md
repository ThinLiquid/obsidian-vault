# Speed-time graph
## Deducing motion from a speed-time graph
| State of object            | Shape of speed-time graph             |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| At rest                    | Horizontal line along the time axis.  |
| Moving at a constant speed | A horizontal line that isn't at zero. |
| Constant acceleration      | Straight line of positive gradient.   |
| Changing acceleration      | A curved graph.                       |
| Constant deceleration      | Straight line of negative gradient.   |
