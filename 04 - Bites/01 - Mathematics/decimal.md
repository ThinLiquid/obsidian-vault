# Decimals
There are two types of fractions **terminating decimals** and **recurring decimals**. Terminating decimals have a limited number of decimal places, whilst recurring decimals continue indefinitely.

> Recurring decimals are **not** irrational numbers.

Examples of terminating decimals include $0.654$, $0.5$ and $0.25$. Examples of recurring decimals include $0.\overline{6}$ and $0.\overline{3}$.
### Fractions
A decimal is simply a fraction expressed in tenths, hundredths and so on.
Decimals can also be represented as fractions. As an example $0.5$ is equivalent to $\dfrac{1}{2}$.

> When working with larger decimals like $0.792$, you can turn them into a fraction like $\dfrac{792}{1000}$.
