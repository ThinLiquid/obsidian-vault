# Boyle's law
**Boyle's law** is a law that states that pressure put on a gas of a given mass, kept at a constant temperature, is inversely proportional to the volume occupied by the gas.

> The higher the pressure, the lower the volume. The lower the pressure, the higher the volume. The pressure and volume are inversely proportional.
> $$P\propto\frac{1}{V}$$
## Example
Finding $V_2$ from $V_1$, $P_1$ and $P_2$:
$$\begin{align}
V_1=(5.0\times10^3)\text{ cm$^3$}\\
P_1=(8.0\times10^5)\text{ Pa}\\
P_2=(1.0\times10^5)\text{ Pa}\\
\\
P_1V_1&=P_2V_2\\
(5.0\times10^3)(8.0\times10^5)&=(1.0\times10^5)(V_2)\\
V_2&=\frac{(8.0\times10^5)(5.0\times10^3)}{(1.0\times10^5)}\\
V_2&=4.0\times10^4
\end{align}$$
