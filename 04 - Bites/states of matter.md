# States of matter
There are three states of matter. The states of matter are solids, liquids and gases. Their symbols are (s), (l) and (g) respectively. The symbols are called **state symbols** and are usually found after the formula or symbol of an element or compound.
## Properties
| State      | Defined Volume | Defined Shape | Compressibility | Flows Easily | Particle Arrangement                  | Force of Attraction                                  | Motion of particles                                 |
|------------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Solid      | X              | X             | -               | -            | Regular pattern                       | Strong                                               | Vibrates around fixed positions                     |
| Liquid     | X              | -             | -               | X            | Irregular pattern                     | Weak                                                 | Moves around each other in a random motion          |
| Gas        | -              | -             | X               | X            | No regular arrangement; random motion | Very weak, particles far apart ― see [[Boyle's law]] | Moves faster and randomly ― see [[Brownian motion]] |

### Liquids
#### Difference between boiling and evaporation
| Boiling                                        | Evaporation                                |
|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Occurs at fixed temperature                    | At any temperature                         |
| Quick process                                  | Slow process                               |
| Bubbles are formed                             | No bubbles are formed                      |
| Takes place throughout the liquid              | Takes place at the surface                 |
| Temperature remains constant                   | Temperature may change                     |
| Thermal energy is supplied by an energy source | Thermal energy supplied by the environment |

To increase the rate of evaporation, you can either increase the temperature (which gives the molecules more thermal energy), increase surface area (which moves more molecules to the surface), or give it cool air (which absorbs the moisture).
