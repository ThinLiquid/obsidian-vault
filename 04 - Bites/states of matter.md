# States of matter
There are three states of matter. The states of matter are solids, liquids and gases. Their symbols are (s), (l) and (g) respectively. The symbols are called **state symbols** and are usually found after the formula or symbol of an element or compound.
## Properties
| State      | Defined Volume | Defined Shape | Compressibility | Flows Easily | Particle Arrangement                  | Force of Attraction            | Motion of particles |
|------------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------|
| Solid      | X              | X             | -               | -            | Regular pattern                       | Strong                         | Vibrates around fixed positions |
| Liquid     | X              | -             | -               | X            | Irregular pattern                     | Weak                           | Moves around each other in a random motion |
| Gas        | -              | -             | X               | X            | No regular arrangement; random motion | Very weak, particles far apart | Moves faster and randomly â€• see [[Brownian motion]] |
