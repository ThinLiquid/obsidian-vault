# Sound
Sound waves are longitudinal waves.
A medium is needed to transmit sound waves.
The greater the amplitude of a sound wave, the louder it is.
The greater the frequency the higher the pitch.
Frequency is the number of cycles per second.
The speed of sound in air is $343\text{ m/s}^{-1}$ .
The speed of sound in water is $1493\text{ m/s}^{-1}$.
The speed of sound in steel is $5130\text{ m/s}^{-1}$.
The range of audible frequencies for a healthy human ear, is from 20Hz to 2000Hz.
Ultrasound is used for SONAR (Sound Navigation and Ranging) and medical imaging.
Sound travels faster in solids, than in liquids and gases.
SONAR is used to detect flaws in materials
SONAR is used to image soft tissues, measure water depth, or locate underwater objects.
Using SONAR, $\text{depth}=\text{speed of sound}\times\text{time}\div2$
