Frequency, wavelength, and speed are all unchanged

 the bending of a wave as it crosses a boundary between two different mediums, causing the wave to change direction due to a change in its speed as it enters a medium with a different density
 
From deep to shallow waters, the wave’s speed decreases as the wavelength becomes shorter.

From shallow to deep waters the wave’s speed increases as the wavelength becomes longer
