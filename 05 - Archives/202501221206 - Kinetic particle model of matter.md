# Kinetic particle model of matter
## "Particle theory" (kinetic theory)
- **Solids**
	- Strong forces of attraction ― held close together
	- Defined shape and volume ― fixed shape
	- Molecules are packed in a regular pattern
	- Cannot be compressed
- **Liquids**
	- Weak forces of attraction ― free to move
	- Shape can change, flows to fit a container
	- Molecules are close together in an irregular pattern
	- Cannot be compressed
- **Gases**
	- Very weak forces of attraction (causes them to move far away) ― free to move
	- Constantly moving with random motion
	- Can be compressed
## What is matter?
Matter is a substance that makes up all physical objects, it has weight and space.
## What is brownian motion?
Brownian motion is the random movement of particles in liquids or gases due to collision.
> Massive particles may be moved by light, fast-moving molecules

The higher the temperature the greater the kinetic energy and the faster the speed of the molecules.
## Celsius to Kelvin
Absolute temperature is temperature measured using the Kelvin scale where zero is _actually_ absolute zero.
$$\text{kelvin}=\text{celcius}+273.15$$
## Boyle's law
$$\begin{align*}V&\propto\frac{1}{P}\\ V&=\frac{k}{P}\\ k&=PV\end{align*}$$
$$P_1V_1=P_2V_2$$
### Example
$$\begin{align*}
V_1=(5.0\times10^3)\text{ cm$^3$}\\
P_1=(8.0\times10^5)\text{ Pa}\\
P_2=(1.0\times10^5)\text{ Pa}\\
\\
P_1V_1&=P_2V_2\\
(5.0\times10^3)(8.0\times10^5)&=(1.0\times10^5)(V_2)\\
V_2&=\frac{(8.0\times10^5)(5.0\times10^3)}{(1.0\times10^5)}\\
V_2&=4.0\times10^4
\end{align*}$$
