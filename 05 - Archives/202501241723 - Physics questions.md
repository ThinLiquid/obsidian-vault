2. Fig 5.1 shows a saucepan of boiling water on an electrical hotplate. As time passes, thermal energy (heat) is constantly supplied to the water but its temperature remains at $100\textdegree\text{C}$.
	1. {a} State two ways in which boiling differs from evaporation.
		1. Bubbles are present when boiling.
		2. Boiling occurs at a fixed temperature.
	2. ==Explain, in terms of the water molecules, what happens to the thermal energy supplied to the water as it boils.==
		1. The thermal energy supplied to the water as it's boiled is converted into steam.
3. ⠀
	1. {a} State the energy changes that take place when
		1. {i} a cyclist rides down a hill without pedalling.
			1. As the cyclist rides down the hill, gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy.
		2. a cyclist pedals up a hill at a constant speed.
			1. Since the cyclist is moving at a constant speed, their kinetic energy does not change.
	2. A car of mass $940\text{ kg}$ is travelling at $16\text{ m/s}$.
		1. {i} Calculate the kinetic energy of the car.
			1. $$\begin{align}KE&=\frac{1}{2}mv^2\\ KE&=\frac{1}{2}(940)(16)^2\\ KE&=120,640\end{align}$$
		2.  The car is brought to rest by applying the breaks. The total mass of the brakes is $4.5\text{ kg}$. The average specific heat capacity of the brake material is $520\text{ J/(kg}\circ\text{C)}$. Calculate the rise in temperature of the brakes. Assume there is no loss of thermal energy from the brakes.
			1. $$\begin{align}Q&=mc\Delta T\\\Delta T&=\frac{Q}{mc}\\\Delta T&=\frac{120,640}{4.5\times520}\\\Delta T&=\frac{120,640}{2,340}\\\Delta T&=51.5^\circ\text{C}\end{align}$$
6. ⠀
	1. {a} Some water is poured onto a plastic table-top, forming a puddle. The same volume of water is poured into a plastic dish, which is placed alongside the puddle. This is illustrated in Fig. 7.1. Both lots of water begin to evaporate.
		1. {i} In terms of the behavior of molecules, describe what happens during the process of evaporation.
		    1. Evaporation occurs when the molecules at the surface of a liquid gain enough energy to escape into the gas phase. These molecules transition from a liquid to a gaseous state, leaving behind molecules with lower kinetic energy, which results in a cooling effect.
		2. Explain why the puddle dries out more rapidly than the water in the dish.
		    1. The puddle dries out more rapidly because it has a larger surface area exposed to the air compared to the water in the dish. This larger surface area allows more water molecules to escape into the air, increasing the rate of evaporation.
		3. State two changes that would make both lots of water evaporate more rapidly.
		    1. Raising the temperature will provide more energy to the water molecules, enhancing their ability to escape into the gas phase.
		    2. Enhancing the airflow around the water will help carry away the water vapor, reducing the relative humidity and promoting faster evaporation.
