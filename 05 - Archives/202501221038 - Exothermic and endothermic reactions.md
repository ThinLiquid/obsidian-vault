# Exothermic and endothermic reactions
## Calculating the enthalpy change
1. Write the balanced equation for the reaction.
2. Find the 'energy in' ― the total bond energies for all bonds in the reactants (left-hand side)
3. Find the 'energy out' ― the total bond energies for all bonds in the products (right-hand side)
4. Use the formula for enthalpy change:
   $$\text{enthalpy change}\space(\Delta H)=\text{energy taken in}-\text{energy given out}$$

> enthalpy is the chemical energy involved in a reaction

If the energy in is less than the energy out, the reaction is exothermic (negative $\Delta H$), and if the energy in is greater than the energy out, the reaction is endothermic (positive $\Delta H$).
### Bond breaking and bond making
Bond making is an exothermic process, whereas bond breaking is an endothermic process.

In exothermic reactions, energy is released when bonds are made, and in endothermic reactions, energy is taken in to break bonds apart.

If the energy needed to break bonds is less than the energy released, then it's an exothermic reaction (negative $\Delta H$). If the energy needed to break bonds is greater than the energy released, it's an endothermic reaction (positive $\Delta H$).
## Reaction pathway diagrams
If the total energy of the reactants is larger than the products, then it's an exothermic reaction, whereas, the total chemical energy is smaller than the products making it an endothermic reaction.

## Home Tasks
- **Define enthalpy change**: Enthalpy change is the energy taken in subtracted by the energy given out
- If the total energy of the reactant is larger than the product, then it is **exothermic** . If the total energy of the reactant it is smaller than the product, it is **endothermic**.
- **Distinguish between bond breaking, and bond making**: Bond making is an exothermic process, whereas bond breaking is an endothermic process. In exothermic reactions, energy is released when bonds are made, and in endothermic reactions, energy is taken in to break bonds apart.
