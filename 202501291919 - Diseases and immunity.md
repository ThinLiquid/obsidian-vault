## Transmissible diseases
There are many factors that can cause diseases. However, diseases that can be passed from one individual to another are called **transmissible diseases**. Common transmissible diseases include:
- colds
- flu
- food poisoning
- sexually transmitted diseases (STIs).

==Transmissible diseases are caused by **pathogens**.== The organism that is infected by a pathogen is called a **host**. Other groups also include pathogens, such as fungi and bacteria. ==**Viruses** that cause diseases are also called pathogens, even though they aren't living organisms.==
