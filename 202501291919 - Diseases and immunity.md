# Diseases and immunity
## Transmissible diseases
There are many factors that can cause diseases. However, diseases that can be passed from one individual to another are called **transmissible diseases**. Common transmissible diseases include:
- colds
- flu
- food poisoning
- sexually transmitted diseases (STIs).

==Transmissible diseases are caused by **pathogens**.== The organism that is infected by a pathogen is called a **host**. Other groups also include pathogens, such as fungi and bacteria. ==**Viruses** that cause diseases are also called pathogens, even though they aren't living organisms.== 
### Viruses
Viruses are simple proteins which consist of an outer protein coat that protects the genetic material inside.

## Methods of transmission
==Transmission is the process of passing a disease from one host to another== host (uninfected initially). Inside the new host the pathogen will reproduce, so that it can infect others.

There are many ways pathogens can be transmitted:

### Direct contact
==Transmission through direct contact are usually transmitted by the transfer of bodily fluids== including: semen, blood, and other bodily fluids. Bodily fluids are usually exchanged during sexual contact or even through sneezing.

Diseases gained through direct contact include: HIV, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C.
### Indirect contact
Transmission through indirect contact are usually transmitted when then pathogen leaves the host in some way and into an uninfected individual.

Examples of indirect transmission include:
- **transmission through water droplets in air**: colds and flu through coughs or sneezes.
- **transmission through infected drinking water**: cholera, typhoid and dysentery.
- **transmission through contaminated surfaces**: athlete’s foot fungus by walking on damp floors, and salmonella/clostridium through food poisoning pathogens spread by flies that have fed on contaminated food or faeces.
- **transmission through insect bites**: malaria and dengue fever through mosquitoes carrying pathogens.

There are many animals that can transfer pathogens from host to another, for example, mosquitoes and flies, however ==these animals aren’t affected by the disease caused by the pathogens they carry.==

**Define the term *transmissible disease*.**
A transmissible disease is a disease caused by pathogens that attaches to any living organism.
